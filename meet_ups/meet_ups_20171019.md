# Python Version Choice

- Highly recommend Python 3. Python 2 is will retire in 2020.
- Python 2 may still be necessary because of legacy code (e.g. `pythonpy` module)
    - use `future` and `2to3` module
    - use **virtualenv** or **conda** to manage different python environments and packages

# Toolkits

- Github
- Anaconda
- Markdown

# Topics

Here is a list of topics we are going to discuss in each meet up. It is not complete. Please feel free to add whatever Python-related topics that you want to talk about

- Python Basics and Programming Environments (PyCharm, Notebook, Atom)
- Python Style
- Python tricks
- Python Debugging
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy (Similar to Matlab), Scipy, Matplotlib(Similar to Matlab), Pandas(Similar to R)
- PsychoPy

# Schedule

Some people want to meet once per month, others want to meet every other week. According to feedbacks and interests, we propose a general schedule like this:

1. a **monthly** meet up to talk about general topics python practices
2. a **biweekly** meet up (in between) to talk about specific one topic in python programming

# Goal

collaboratively create a codebase on Github that everyone can add to and access, and find it useful and helpful in his/her research.
